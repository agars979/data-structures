# Dear Diary

We first decided a topic to write about. I decided to write recipes. We then deciphered how to structure our data based on our topic such that we could prove that it required to be part of a NoSQL Database.

After deciphering the same we added the diary entries into DynamoDB.

We then tried to understand user goals and created a query.

We then intended to transfer this information visually, but were only able to extract the query results.
